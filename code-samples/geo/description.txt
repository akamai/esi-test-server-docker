Example: Eliminating a splash screen for geographies

Description : The following ESI example eliminates the need for a splash
screen that gathers an end-users geographic information and directs them to
the appropriate page accordingly. Using ESI the spash screen can be eliminated
as it can use the EdgeScape information in ESI to send the user automatically to
the appropriate page.

Logic of the page: End users country code is checked by ESI's variable and if it 
matches US or DE or JP or FR the appropriate page is returned. If none of the country
codes checked match, a default page is returned.
