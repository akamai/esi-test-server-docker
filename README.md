# Akamai ETS Docker Image

## About
This container runs the Akamai Edge Side Includes Test Server. The container OS is Ubuntu 14.04
Trusty Tahr. Configuration is set via environment variables passed via Docker.

For more information on ESI, please visit https://www.akamai.com/us/en/support/esi.jsp.
For code samples, see http://esi-examples.akamai.com/.

## Running
By default, the servers run on ports 80 (ETS) and 81 (sandbox), with a hostname
of localhost. Neither GEO nor ESI Debugging are enabled by default.

Users can add to the basic settings using the `CONFIGURE_EXTRA_OPTS` environment
variable, or completely override all settings using the `CONFIGURE_OPTS`
environment variable.

### Basic usage
`docker run -d --net host akamai-ets:latest`

### Basic usage (ESI Debugging enabled for localhost)
`docker run -d --net host -e "CONFIGURE_EXTRA_OPTS=--debug localhost"
akamai-ets:latest`

### Basic usage (remote origin with ESI Debugging enabled)
`docker run -d --net host -e "CONFIGURE_EXTRA_OPTS=--remote_origin
www.akamai.com:443 --debug www.akamai.com" akamai-ets:latest`

### Basic usage (remote origin with GEO setting)
`docker run -d --net host -e "CONFIGURE_EXTRA_OPTS=--remote_origin
www.akamai.com:443 --geo
www.akamai.com:www.akamai.com:georegion=246,country_code=US,region_code=CA, \
city=SANJOSE,dma=807,pmsa=7400,areacode=408,county=SANTACLARA,fips=06085, \
lat=37.3353,long=-121.8938,timezone=PST,network_type=dialup" akamai-ets:latest`

### Advanced usage (changing default hostname and ports - note the use of -p)
`docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -e
"CONFIGURE_OPTS=--local_hostname=mymachine.corporate.network --ets_port=8080
--sandbox_port=8081" akamai-ets:latest`

Could be accessed using `curl -v -L -H 'Host: mymachine.corporate.network'
http://localhost:8081/` (Substitute `localhost` with the hostname of the Docker
host if needed.)

## Networking
Users have a variety of options for how to expose ports. The simplest is to use
`--net host`, which will expose the default ports (80 and 81) via the IP of the
Docker host. See [this
article](https://www.ctl.io/developers/blog/post/docker-networking-rules/) for
more information.

If `--net host` doesn't work for you, or you wish to use different ports, try 
port fowarding, e.g. `-p 80:80 -p 81:81`.

### Note for Docker for Mac
Docker for Mac doesn't currently support `--net host`; [you must forward ports](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#there-is-no-docker0-bridge-on-macos).

## Configuration Settings
* `--local_hostname=<hostname>` - default hostname for the ETS server and
  sandbox server to listen on
* `--ets_port=<port>` - port for the ETS server to listen on
* `--sandbox_port=<port>` - port for the sandbox (local non-ESI origin) to
  listen on
* `--remote_origin <hostname:port>` - hostname and port to use for an additional
  remote/upstream origin
* `--debug <hostname>` - enable ESI debugging for that hostname
* `--geo <hostname:settings>` - enable Edgescape for a hostname via mock data
    - Sample GEO flag:
      `www.akamai.com:georegion=246,country_code=US,region_code=CA,city=SANJOSE,
      dma=807,pmsa=7400,areacode=408,county=SANTACLARA,fips=06085,lat=37.3353,
      long=-121.8938,timezone=PST,network_type=dialup`

## TLS/HTTPS
The ESI test server doesn't support HTTPS for incoming connections, but remote
origins using TLS are supported; just add them with port 443, e.g.
`--remote_origin www.akamai.com:443`.

## Container as origin
In some cases, you may want to specify a server running in another container as
an origin. There are [diverse ways to achieve
this](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), but following is
one example, where a combination of Docker's `--add-host` parameter and the port
in ETS' `--remote_origin` parameter is used to route the upstream request to
another container.
* `docker run -p 8080:8080 -d -v <directory of ESI files>:/public
  redsadic/docker-http-server`
* `docker run -d --net host -e "CONFIGURE_EXTRA_OPTS=--remote_origin
  test.box:8080" --add-host test.box:<Docker host IP> akamai-ets:latest`

## Viewing logs and modifying files
You can shell into the container using `docker exec -ti <container ID> bash`.
Logs can be found in `/opt/akamai-ets/logs`.

## Mounting a directory of ESI pages
You can trivially mount HTML files containing ESI tags in the sandbox server as follows:

`docker run -d --net host -v $(pwd)/esi_pages:/opt/akamai-ets/virtual/localhost/docs
akamai-ets:latest`

If you issue requests via the ETS port (80 by default), the ESI tags will be processed. If you want to enable ESI debugging, pass the `--debug localhost` parameter via the `CONFIGURE_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable. (Substitute `localhost` for the value of the `--local_hostname` parameter if applicable.
